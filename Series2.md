## Series2 (G2) Pano Logic devices

The second generation device has a SPI flash chip that is large enough to 
hold two complete bitstreams, the main bitstream and a backup.  This allows 
the device to automatically recover from unexpected errors or power 
failures while updating the main image.  (Note: Xilinx documentation 
refers to the main and backup bitstream are referred as the multiboot 
golden bitstreams)

## Differences between series 2 revisions

The first two revisions (A and B) of the G2 used the Spartan-6 LX150 
which is the largest chip in the family while the last revision (C) used 
the smaller LX100 chip.  Correspondingly the A and B revisions used a 16 megabyte 
SPI chip (M25P128) while the revisions C used a 8 megabyte (M25P64) chip.

Since the bitstreams are embedded into progfpga there are 4 different 
versions of progfpga depending on the desired bitstream and the revision of 
the target Pano.  Even though there are separate programs for each 
bitstream type progfpga still requires a command line argument to specify
the bitstream type.  To simplify usage patch_progfpga creates an script 
to execute the proper executable with the correct arguments.

In order for patch_progfpga to select the proper progfpga to 
patch it is necessary to specify both the device revision and bitstream type on 
the command line.  

When programming a revision A or B G2 specify '-2' on 
then command line, for a revision C G2 specify '-c'.  

To program the main bitstream specify '-m' on then command line,
for the backup bitstream specify '-g'.  

| Revision |    Bitstream     |   Command line     |
|----------|------------------|--------------------|
| A or B   | main (multiboot) | ./patch_fpga -2 -m |
|   C      | main (multiboot) | ./patch_fpga -c -m |
| A or B   | backup (golden)  | ./patch_fpga -2 -g |
|   C      | backup (golden)  | ./patch_fpga -c -g |


## Patching progfpga

* Checkout the pano_progfpga repository.
* CD into pano_progfpga.
* Build the patch program.
* Run patch_progfpga giving agrements specifying type of Pano which will 
be updated and the path to the binary Xilinx image file to embed into 
progfpga.  

For example to flash a revision B G2 with a new main image:

```
skip@dell-790:~/pano$ git clone https://github.com/skiphansen/pano_progfpga.git

patched/series2/lx150/progfpga_multiboot updated successfully with ../panologic-g2/spinal/ise/Pano.bin
progfpga script created successfully.

To flash series2 Rev A/B with the default bitstream:
   ./progfpga -d
   ./progfpga <ip address>
skip@dell-790:~/pano/pano_progfpga$
```

## Flashing the image over the network

Flashing a Pano device with the patched progfpga utility is exactly the 
same is as explained in Pano video, namely: 

* Plug the Pano into your local LAN.
* Turn it on.
* Wait for it to obtain an IP address via DHCP.
* Discover it's IP address.
* Update it.
* Cross your fingers and wait as the Pano is updated.  (Go get coffee, 
this will take a good amount of time).  
* Power cycle the Pano and enjoy your new image.

For example:

```

## FAQ

* Q: Which bitstream should I program?
* A: In almost all cases you'll want to program the main/multiboot bitstream.
     This is the bitstream that is loaded on power up.  I recommend that you
     **NOT** program the backup/golden image.

* Q: Is is possible to "brick" my Pano?

* A: That depends on your definition of a "brick".  It should always be 
     possible to recover a Pano that has been flashed with an incorrect or with 
     an undesiredable bitstream using a JTAG programmer, but it will not be 
     possible to reflash a Pano without a JTAG programmer unless the flashed 
     bitstream provides a way to execute the stock Pano backup (golden) image 
     **and** the backup image is still present in flash.  
  
* Q: Why is it so slow?
  A: The Pano code only programs one word a time and the flash isn't all that
     fast to start with. 

* Q: How can I tell what generation my devices is?
  A: If your device has a VGA connector then it is a Series 1 (G1).
     If your device has a DVI connector then it is a Series 2 (G2).
     
* Q: How can I tell what revision my devices is?
  A: The device revision should be printed on the same stick on label as the MAC address.  
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skiphansen/pano_blocks/master/assets/panog2_rev_c.png)]


* Q: How do I update the Pano after I flash my bitstream?
  A: See [g2_multiboot](./g2_multiboot) for an example of how to reconfigure
     the device with the golden bitstream.  If JTAG is available the example
     can be loaded via JTAG, it will reconfigure the device with the golden
     bitstream when the Pano button is pressed.

* Q: I programmed the golden bitstream but when I power cycle it's still the Pano
     bitstream.
  A: Correct!  The "multiboot" bitstream image is loaded at power up the golden
     bitstream is only loaded if the "mutiboot" bitstream fails to load.

## Random thoughts about a future bootloader for G2 devices

As can be seen from the memory map above there is enough room for 3 complete 
bitstreams in the G2 flash.  This makes it possible for an application to 
allow a user to select between two completely different applications as 
well a the orignal Pano bitstream without reflashing.  

However if we're more clever it might be possible to store considerably 
more than 3 bitstreams if we consider the following: 

The uncompressed xc6lx150 bitstream with trivial complexity size of 
4220212 is reduced to 1152184 bytes when bitstream compression is enabled 
in ISE.  This is essentially free, since such a compressed bitstream can 
be loaded by the Xilinx without any additional processing.  

The size of the same bitstream size is only 66029 when gziped.  If we were 
to store gzip'ed bitstream in flash it would be possible to store a lot 
more bitstreams but code running on a softcore would have to decompress 
the bitstream and write it into flash in order for the Xilinx to be able 
to load it.
